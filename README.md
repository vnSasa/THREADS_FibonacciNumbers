# THREADS_FibonacciNumbers

Create a MyThread class to inherit it from the Thread class. Redefine the run() method so that the number of Fibonacci numbers entered from the console can be output. To do this, use the Scanner class in the run () method. That is, we enter from the console how many Fibonacci numbers we want to see and we output them with a delay of 1 second.

Create a RunnableThread class implement it from the Runnable interface. Redefine the run() method so that the Fibonacci numbers are output in reverse order. That is, first entered through the Scanner how many Fibonacci numbers we want to see, then with a delay of 1 second to display them from the last to the first value.

The first and second threads must output one line of the number.
Console view:
Thread Thread: 1 1 2 3 5. . .
Stream Runnable:. . .5 3 2 1 1
